# M2_Fire-Alarm
## Introduction
Nowadays, fire incidents have become a critical issue , which must be dealt with on time without any unnecessary delay to avoid the loss in lives and belongings . It is considered a fire situation when the monitored temperature exceeds 50o C. In critical places such as hospitals, schools, and banks, personnel's arrival time to come for help in fire hazards is around 15 minutes

## Objective Of the Project
The 4 Purposes of Your Fire Alarm System The four ways your fire alarm system works to protect your property and its occupants from the dangers of fire are by detecting fire, alerting occupants, managing risk, and notifying the fire department.

## Detect Fire
Your fire alarm system is designed to detect fire in two main ways: smoke and heat. It should also have the capability of manual pull, in case a fire is observed before smoke or heat reaches the sensors of the system. Other systems are activated when movement in the sprinkler system is detected, indicating that the sprinklers are responding to a fire.
